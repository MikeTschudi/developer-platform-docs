Playlists are a useful tool in a variety of different scenarios:
* To string a number of entries together or to play back one entry after another
* To power sections of the application UI, with content lists that are made easy to order or even created automatically.

Kaltura supports two different types of playlists:
* Manual Playlists: Content is added manually and sorted
* Rule-Based/Conditional Playlists: Content is added based on a set of filters and sorted based on selected criteria

To understand how playlists are configured and used, see:

### Quick Start
Kaltura playlists can be added, updated, deleted and listed via the [`playlist service`](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Search_Discover_and_Personalize/playlist).
